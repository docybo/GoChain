## 2. Core Components

### ‚úÖ Blockchain Node (Substrate-based)

* **Consensus:** Delegated Proof of Stake (DPoS) using customized staking pallet.
* **Governance:** On-chain governance with voting, proposals, and treasury.
* **Identity:** Support for SSI via DID & Verifiable Credentials pallet.
* **Compliance Module:** Optional KYC/AML features (configurable per region).
* **Bridge & Interoperability Ready:** Prepared for IBC, ChainBridge, and other interoperability standards.

### ‚úÖ Mobile-First Access

* **USSD Gateway Backend:**

  * Node.js-based.
  * Integrates with Africa's Talking or Twilio USSD APIs.
  * Handles feature phone users with no data access.
* **SMS Interface:**

  * Backup communication channel for transaction confirmations.
* **Light App (Optional):**

  * React Native.
  * Offline-first wallet app.
  * USSD fallback embedded inside.

### ‚úÖ Scalability Layer (Future Phase)

* **Layer 2 Rollups:**

  * Support for zkRollups for cheap microtransactions.
* **Sidechains:**

  * Specialized regional chains.
  * Local community currency or DeFi.

### ‚úÖ Privacy & Security

## 3. Infrastructure & Deployment

* **Validator Nodes:**

  * Mix of cloud (AWS Cape Town, local DCs) & on-prem.
  * DPoS validator elections (21 active at a time).
* **Relayer Nodes:**

  * For interoperability and bridges.
* **Mesh Networking / Offline Sync Nodes (Future Phase):**

  * For areas without internet.
  * Syncs via SMS, LoRa, or radio.
